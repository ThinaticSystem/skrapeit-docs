# Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
[**skrape{it}**](http://www.skrape.it) is a Kotlin-based HTML / XML testing and web scraping parser-library that can be used seamlessly in Spring-Boot, Android or other JVM projects. It places particular emphasis on ease of use, a high level of readability, attention to performance through the use of non-blocking operations and is not bound to a specific test runner.

## A Story of Deserializing HTML

Have you ever heard of the [**kotlinx.html**](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html) DSL?  
In case you don't, it is a Kotlin multiplatform library that provides a type-safe DSL to build / serialize static HTML right from your Kotlin code.

But what if we want to do it the other way around and deserialize HTML or XML in Kotlin?

ðŸ’ª Let's rescue the world \(at least in terms of html scraping ðŸ¤“\) and do it the Kotlin way.

The idea to have a Kotlin-based library to scrape or parse HTML / XML was getting clearer after seeing the awesome talk about [_**Creating Internal DSLs in Kotlin**_](https://kotlinconf.com/talks/#date=5-october&session=41599) \_**\*\*\_by Venkat Subramaniam at the KotlinConf 2018 in Amsterdam. Totally amazed by the readability and the possibilities a DSL written in Kotlin provides, the idea of** Skrape{it}\*\* was born!

The major paradigms of the library are that it's flexible, highly readable, not bound to specific test-runner and reactive / non blocking

> Hold on, hold on. I'm already knowing a library that is doing what you described, it's called [jSoup](https://jsoup.org) or I could could just use Selenium in order to behave in the manner mentioned above.

Nearly true. **Skrape{it}** is using jSoup internally to parse HTML documents. But since jSoup is written in Java it's neither null-safe nor intuitiv to use and read. Skrape{it} _\*\*_abstracts the idea of jSoup but it's easy to use by having a focus on readability by simplicity.  
Furthermore, Skrape{it} offers the possibility to verify expectations by offering a DSL that is specifically designed to do HTML-related assertions and bindings for well-known testing libraries and HTTP clients.
