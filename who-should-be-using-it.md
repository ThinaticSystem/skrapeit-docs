# Who should be using it

**The following scenarios may answer these questions best:**

{% hint style="success" %}
"I would like to test the endpoints of my application that produces HTML/XML in a meaningful and idiomatic way!"
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
"I'm running a huge Selenium suite that is checking the appearance of certain elements and its values. Therefore I'm looking for a fast and reliable alternative with less overhead!"
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
"I'm maintaining a complex application with high SEO requirements, therefore i want to have e2e tests checking the relevant meta tag information!"
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
"I need to refactor an \(legacy or hard to mock\) application that produces HTML/XML and want to have high level tests that ensure my changes fulfill the expectations!"
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
"I'm an Android developer and want to write proper tests for my Manifest file, XML Layout files and other XML related stuff within my project!"
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
"I want to grab some data from a website that's not providing an API!"
{% endhint %}

These are just a few reasons that came to our mind  from time to time and if you think one these quotes have came to your mind as well you should definitely give **skrape{it}** a try.
