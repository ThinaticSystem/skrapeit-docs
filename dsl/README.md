# How to Use

### The Skrape{it} DSL$$_1$$ is the recommended way of using the library. It offers the highest level of features and usability.

The DSL should be nearly self-explaining. Depending on your use-case here is an example with explanations on how to use skrape{it} to write integration tests that validates an endpoint or an URL that is returning HTML:

{% page-ref page="basic-test-scenario.md" %}

Further information on what is the best way to actually scrape the content of an webpage and work with that data can be found here:
