# How to Use

The [**skrape{it}**](../) **MockMvc-extension** will extend MockMvc's `ResultActions` with an `andExpectHtml{}` lambda function. The scope of the lambda will give you a parsed response body \(deserialized to a `Doc`\) and enables you to make comfortable assumptions about the content, properties and structure of the document.
