# How to Use

The [**skrape{it}**](../) **Ktor-extension** will extend Ktor's `TestApplicationResponse` with an`expectHtml{}` lambda function. The scope of the lambda will give you a parsed response body \(deserialized to a `Doc`\) and enables you to make comfortable assumptions about the content, properties and structure of the document.
